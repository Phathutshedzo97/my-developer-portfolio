    <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Phathutshedzo</strong>, a passionate and aspiring 
    <strong> Full Stack Web Developer</strong> from the vibrant town of 
    <strong> Thohoyandou</strong> in the <strong>Limpopo Province</strong>, South Africa. 
    My journey into the world of technology has been both exciting and transformative.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold a <strong>BCom in Accounting</strong>, which gave me a solid foundation in 
    analytical thinking and problem-solving. However, my curiosity for the digital world 
    and a desire to create meaningful, innovative solutions led me to pursue a 
    <strong> Full Stack Web Developer course</strong> with <strong>HyperionDev</strong>. 
    This step has allowed me to bridge my background in commerce with cutting-edge tech 
    skills, opening new horizons in my career.
  </p>
  <h2>My Vision</h2>
  <p>
    I believe in crafting <strong>user-friendly, efficient, and visually appealing web 
    solutions</strong>. Whether itâ€™s designing sleek front-end interfaces or building 
    robust back-end systems, I strive to deliver high-quality work that makes a difference.
  </p>
  <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, connecting with 
    like-minded individuals, and finding ways to merge my creative and technical sides.
  </p>
  <p>Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>
